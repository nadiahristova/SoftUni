Projects are represented by boards, which contain lists (corresponding to task lists). Lists contain cards (corresponding to tasks). Cards are supposed to progress from one list to the next (via drag-and-drop), for instance mirroring the flow of a feature from idea to implementation. <u>Users</u> can be assigned to <u>cards</u>. <u>Users and boards</u> can be grouped into <u>organizations</u>.</p>
