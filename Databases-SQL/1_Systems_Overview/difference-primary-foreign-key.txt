Primary Key - A primary key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identify a row. Every table should have a primary key. And a table cannot have more than one primary key. The PRIMARY KEY characteristic can be specified as part of a column definition or it can be specified as a separate clause of the CREATE TABLE statement. 

- Primary key uniquely identify a record in the table.
- Primary Key can't accept null values.
- By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index.
- We can have only one Primary key in a table.


Foreign Key - A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table whose values must have matching values in the primary key of another (or the same) table. A foreign key is said to reference its primary key. Foreign keys are a mechanism for maintaining data integrity. 

- Foreign key is a field in the table that is primary key in another table.
- Foreign key can accept multiple null value.
- Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on foreign key.
- We can have more than one foreign key in a table.

Foreign, primary, and unique keys are not restricted to having just one column from a given table – each type of key can cover multiple columns.
