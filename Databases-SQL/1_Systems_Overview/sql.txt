SQL allows users to access data stored in a relational database management system. Users can create and delete databases, as well as set permissions on database tables, views and procedures. It also allows users to manipulate the data within a database.
In SQL, there are two main sets of commands that are used to create and modify databases. These are the Data Definition Language and the Data Manipulation Language. The former contains commands used to develop and delete databases and its objects, and the latter contains commands used to insert, modify and delete data stored in a database.
The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
* Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)
* Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data
* Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.
* Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.
* Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.
* SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.
* Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.
 SQL queries are the most essential and common SQL operations. An SQL query helps users retrieve needed data from a database, and it is executed using the ‘Select’ statement.

Purpose of SQL Structured Query Language is to provide a Structured way by which one can Query information in database using a standard Language.
SQL provides a global standard of working with databases with little or not differences over different platform. For e.g. if you are familiar with SQL you can work with major DBs like SQL Server mySql &Oracle few minor differences in syntax exists but they aren’t very prominent at least as far as basic operations are concerned.

Simple example:
SELECT isbn,
       title,
       price,
       price * 0.06 AS sales_tax
 FROM  Book
 WHERE price > 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
